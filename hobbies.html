  <h1>These are my hobbies</h1>
   <h2>Playing CSGO with my friends </h2>
  <p>I like to spend a couple hours playing a great videogame with my friends and just relieve stress. </p>
  <h3>Watching Youtube </h3>
  <p>I probably spend too much time doing this. Spending hours entertaining myself with this platfrom has consumed much of my life. </p>
  <h4> Chlling with my friends</h4>
  <p>I don't think there is anything better than spending a day with some of my favorite people whether it's chilling on a couch or going to Target. </p>
  <h5>Being a hooligan </h5>
  <p>This ties in with the last one.</p>

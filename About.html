    <h2>Stone Arch </h2>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="stonearch.jpg" alt="Stone arch" height="500" class="rotateimg270"></div>
    <p>This is my favorite picture that I have ever taken. I really like to travel and take pictures of all the beautiful places I have been. I feel like this picture really shows the location in all of its beauty. Sorry about the weird orientation on the picture.   </p> 
    <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="skull.jpg" alt="Deer skull" height="500"></div>
    <p>Another thing I like to do is hunting. While hunting I sometimes find some interesting things in the woods. This skull is one of them. </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="waterfall.jpg" alt="waterfall" height="500"></div>
    <p>This is probably my second favorite photo I've taken. I've always loved waterfalls, I think they are some of the most beautiful thngs nature has made. </p>

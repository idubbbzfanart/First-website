      <h1>Question</h1>
     
      
      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>We collected our data by licking over 100 M and M's and recording how long it took to get to the center,
      how hany licks it took to get to the center, and the color of the M and M's.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
      <p>We fount that, through the power of messing with google sheets for about a half an hour, that on average the green M and M's 
       were the easiest to lick, they took an average 42 licks and 15 seconds, compared to the red M and M's,
       which took 48 licks over 18 seconds.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In conclusion, we have fount that on average the M and M's do not vary in amount of licks very much, only going between
      42 and 48, and lick times are also very similar, ranging between 15 and 21.</p>

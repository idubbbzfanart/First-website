      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>We used the site Tuvalabs.com which is a website that allows you to search through a large amount of databases
      and try to find trends and results. In particular we searched for diseases and found after a concidrable amount of time searching
      that the main three diseases we would focus on would be the aids outbreak, the zika outbreak, and measles.</p>
      <br>
